```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entity/          # Business entities and data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ repository/      # Data access layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ service/         # Business logic layer
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controller/      # HTTP handlers and routing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/      # Authentication, CORS, validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/          # Configuration and database setup
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go          # Application entry point
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Gin (HTTP web framework)
- **ORM**: GORM (Object-relational mapping)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Validation**: go-playground/validator
- **Configuration**: Environment variables

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21 or higher
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ticketing-system
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=your_password
   DB_NAME=ticketing_system

   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here-change-in-production
   JWT_EXPIRE_HOURS=24

   GIN_MODE=debug
   PORT=8080

   ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@ticketing.com
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
   ```

4. **Create MySQL database**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ticketing_system;
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080`
